**# Transport Fuel Efficiency Analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn**

This project is part of the ASC23 coursework and focuses on analyzing vehicle data to understand transport-related patterns, particularly in fuel consumption, emissions, and correlations between vehicle features. The visualizations and interpretations aim to contribute to region-focused insights for climate action.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains vehicle-related features such as:

* Make and Model
* Engine Size
* Fuel Type
* Fuel Consumption (City, Highway, Combined)
* CO2 Emissions
* Fuel Efficiency Score

Source: Provided via Google Drive for the assignment.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Libraries Used

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## üéâ Visualizations

### 1. Histogram of Combined Fuel Consumption

* Shows the distribution of vehicles by their combined fuel usage (L/100km).
* Most vehicles fall between 20 and 30 L/100km, with a right-skew indicating fewer extremely high-consumption cars.

**Interpretation:** Majority of cars are moderately efficient, while few outliers consume significantly more fuel.

### 2. Heatmap of Correlation Matrix

* Displays correlations between all numeric features.
* Enabled with annotations (`annot=True`) for value clarity.

**Interpretation:**

* `UCity` and `city` are highly correlated; same for `UHighway` and `highway`.
* Suggests these columns may be redundant and candidates for dropping in modeling to reduce multicollinearity.
* Strong negative correlation found between fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.
